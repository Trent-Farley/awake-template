Lila (pictured above) helping her owner pick up trash along the beaches of South Florida. Not only is this amazing dog cleaning the beaches, she is also diving into the ocean to grab even more trash. Her dives can go as deep as 15 ft with a pretty high sucess rate.

Whenever Lila is not saving the world one piece of trash at a time, she is riding in her Wuff wagon looking for new places to clean.
